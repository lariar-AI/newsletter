Big Data & Analytics - Thinks and Links

**Happy Friday!**

This may be the defining chart of our generation:

<img src="media/image1.jpeg" style="width:2.58389in;height:1.60417in"
alt="r/singularity - &quot;The number of AI papers on arXiv per month grows exponentially with doubling rate of 24 months.&quot;" />

That’s a picture from 2021 of the pace of research for Machine Learning
and Artificial Intelligence in terms of the number of new research
papers released each month. The amount of innovation in the overall Data
and AI community right now is astounding. There is a perfect storm of
conditions creating a hype cycle that may be larger than the cycles for
Cloud, Mobile, or even Internet. Those conditions:

- That chart and the implication of how much new stuff is being tried at
  all times

- The ongoing explosion of data to train on

- The abundance of cloud computing (and innovation in algorithms
  enabling efficient training without budget-destroying processing)

- An economic “malaise” where companies are already thinking about cost
  cutting and automation.

- Did you see that chart? If it was possible to visualize the open
  source and private model variations and experimentations inspired by
  ChatGPT and GPT-4 it would have that same shape

- Expectations from investors, boards, and executives that due to all of
  the above companies need to get serious about AI

What a time to be alive. Perhaps we’ll look back next year and think of
these as the boom times when expectations were high, and hype was
overheated. Remember the metaverse? But I don’t think so. The articles
I’m seeing and the conversations I’m hearing are telling me the
opposite.

We polled the audience in this [Wednesday’s Enablement Coffee
Break](https://optiv.sharepoint.com/sites/OptivEnablement/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FOptivEnablement%2FEnablement%2FEnablement%20Coffee%20Break%20%E2%80%93%20Data%20Analytics%20%26%20AI%20%28May%203%2C%202023%29%20%2Emp4&referrer=SharePoint&referrerScenario=HighlightedContent%2DSharePoint)
(about Data and AI at Optiv) and there was an even split for how many
were excited about AI ~40% and how many think its very risky ~40%. But
there was no question that 74% of the people who attended had heard
their clients talking about cost pressures driven in part by the
conditions above. Everyone has too much data. Everyone needs to cut
costs. Everyone is fielding questions from the board about AI and better
analytics.

Looking at that chart again I’ve found myself wondering this week: maybe
we’re not hyped enough.

**Stock Price After AI**

<https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/02/chegg-drops-more-than-40percent-after-saying-chatgpt-is-killing-its-business.html>

Depending who you ask Chegg either provides [homework assistance and
online tutoring](https://www.chegg.com/) or is the [leading source for
cheating on homework and
quizes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2021/01/28/this-12-billion-company-is-getting-rich-off-students-cheating-their-way-through-covid/?sh=54800e8c363f).
Regardless – it was doing extremely well until March when “… we saw a
significant spike in student interest in ChatGPT. We now believe it’s
having an impact on our new customer growth rate.” With these words by
CEO on Monday’s earnings call 40% of the company’s valuation vanished.
This is one more statistic that boards and CEOs will be thinking about
as they contemplate the impact of AI on their stock price. Plan
accordingly.

**Google’s Concerned and OpenAI Should Be To**

<https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither>

This article is not about evil AI. Although Google is also concerned
about that. This article is instead about some apparently leaked
internal documents from Google about the rise of the Open Source AI
ecosystem. TLDR – there are countless powerful AI models that can
provide all sorts of economic benefits that do not need to be served by
Google (or other AI giants). These models can be trained for small
amounts of money and provide similar benefits. And so all of the
investment and research to get to this point may end up being far less
profitable than Google (and other AI giants) projects. We’re still in
the first inning of this hockey game, but for example check out the
following references from Google:

- LLMs on a Phone: [People are running foundation models on a Pixel

- Scalable Personal AI: [You can finetune a personalized AI on your
  laptop in an evening](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora).

- Responsible Release: This one isn’t “solved” so much as “obviated”.

**AI Goes to Washington**

<https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/04/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-promote-responsible-ai-innovation-that-protects-americans-rights-and-safety/>

CEOs of Alphabet, Anthropic, Microsoft, and OpeanAI gathered on Thursday
in Washington with Vice President Harris and senior Administration
officials to discuss AI and society. The linked statement includes a
list of some of the investments and activities the Administration is
taking with respect to AI. This includes more investment into
responsible AI research and development, a large-scale penetration test
of AI platforms in and around the DEFCON 31 conference, and the release
of the Federal Government’s own AI policy guidance for both using and
defending AI.

**Box AI**

<https://twitter.com/levie/status/1653620490853044224?s=12&t=Xfz7Jt8IbctmDVkKOxciGw>

This is a very cool soon-to-be-released feature of the popular cloud
storage platform Box where AI can allow you to talk to your files. If
your files are purely public domain examples like the 120 page Fed paper
in the link this is awesome! However if you are looking to find new
vulnerabilities in locations rich with sensitive data this also looks
pretty enticing. Features like this are creeping in to tools everywhere,
and it is important that cyber security and risk has a say over when and
if they get enabled.

**Open Bing AI**

<https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/04/microsoft-doubles-down-on-ai-with-new-bing-features/>

As of yesterday, the AI chat functionality on
[www.bing.com](http://www.bing.com) that uses OpenAI is open to the
public. No waitlist or license needed. (You will have to use Microsoft
Edge browser though). One feature I really like about Bing’s chatbot is
that it shows sources of information used in the response.

<img src="media/image3.png" style="width:4.58635in;height:1.84679in"
alt="A screenshot of a chat Description automatically generated with medium confidence" />

Additional new functionality that is available or imminent:

- Visual and personalized search/chat responses

- Image and graphic-centric answers

- Ability to draw in content from third-party plugins

- Create charts and graphs

- Understand images as well as text

- Store users' chat histories and permit exports

**ChatGPT-Detector for Education Falsely Accused Cheating**

<https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/01/chatgpt-cheating-detection-turnitin/>

Detecting AI-written text is hard. Some people write like robots. Some
robots write like people. AI detection is not reliable enough.

**AI Best Practice: Don’t Use Impersonate an Athlete with AI for a
Magazine Cover Article**

<https://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/36235366/michael-schumacher-family-take-legal-action-fake-ai-interview>

When [Joe Rogan Interviewed Steve
Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbK5Q9y7QEw) six months ago it was
clearly meant as a demonstration of the technology and a fascinating
“what if” provided by AI. When Germen magazine Die Aktuelle announced a
cover story with an interview with F1 champion Michael Schumacher they
neglected to mention that it was via AI since Schumacher has been out of
the public eye since a 2013 skiing accident.

**Optiv in IT Brew**

<https://www.itbrew.com/stories/2023/04/28/coders-take-first-crack-at-ai-in-the-enterprise>

“One should never be copy-pasting something out of ChatGPT or somewhere
else and just running that code in production; that’s just a recipe for
disaster,” said Randy Lariar, practice director for big data and
analytics at the consultancy Optiv. “But if you’re an experienced
developer…you can certainly get a lot of acceleration.”

**Unpacking the Hype: Navigating the Complexities of Advanced Data
Analytics in Cybersecurity**

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZKGLc0eoOY&t=41s>

The cybersecurity industry is experiencing an explosion of innovative
tools designed to tackle complex security challenges. However, the hype
surrounding these tools has outpaced their actual capabilities, leading
many teams to struggle with their complexity and struggle to extract
value from their investment.

To address these challenges, Cribl's Ed Bailey and Optiv's Randy Lariar
will explore the potential and issues of bringing advanced data
analytics, including artificial intelligence, to the cybersecurity
space. They shared insights on where teams should focus their attention
and how to set realistic expectations on what will deliver true value
and what may not justify the investment of time and money. It is crucial
to have the right people and processes in place to maximize the return
on investment from these tools.

**Have a Great Weekend!**
