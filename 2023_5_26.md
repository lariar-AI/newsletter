Big Data & Analytics - Thinks and Links

**Happy Friday!**

It appears that chains are the future. When ChatGPT started to take the
world by storm earlier this year, there was a moment where “Prompt
Engineer” sounded like the next hot new job. However recent research and
practical applications of AI (including Optiv projects) are showing the
value of thinking in chains rather than in mega-prompts.

A lot of recent research and development has been focused on the impact
of chaining AI prompts together, which has shown great promise in
enhancing both the quality and the safety of AI outputs. ([An
Example](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2110.01691)) Instead of
relying on a single prompt, we create a series of prompts and use the
output of one as the input for the next. This process can take various
forms such as pre-processing raw text inputs, refining the outputs, or
even generating text in a specific format and quality​​. It's a bit like
handing off a baton in a relay race, with each leg of the race being a
different prompt and task. This chaining approach provides several key
benefits:

- It allows for the execution of more complex and detailed tasks.

- It breaks these down into explainable and auditable components.

- It allows greater control over the quality of outputs.

- It also solves the issue of context length limitations in large
  language models

Safety and control are significantly enhanced by chaining AI prompts
together. By breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable
sub-tasks, we can increase the likelihood of successful task completion.
This is because each sub-task in the chain can be handled more
effectively than if we tried to tackle the entire task in one go. For
instance, instead of asking an AI model to write a constructive review
in one step, we could break it down into smaller sub-tasks: extracting
presentation problems, brainstorming suggestions, and then synthesizing
these into a friendly paragraph. The result? A noticeably improved
output​.

This concept is one of the reasons that tools like [Microsoft Power
Virtual Agents](https://powervirtualagents.microsoft.com/en-us/)
(nocode) and [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) (code) are
very popular for AI development.

Chaining AI prompts together isn't just about making AI more powerful,
but also about making it more transparent, controllable, and
collaborative. Think in chains to unlock greater capability and safety.

**Data Fabric for Security and Business – By Microsoft**

<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-microsoft-fabric-data-analytics-for-the-era-of-ai/>

Microsoft announced a new platform for a unified data lake that can
connect to any source, process any data, and connect to uses like Power
BI, Automations, and of course AI. This is an evolution and a rebranding
of much of the existing data technology – made easier to consume. It
will also come equipped with Azure OpenAI Service throughout, enabling
rapid development and deployment of AI throughout your data processes.

Organizations that are already using Databricks will already be familiar
with the Delta format – an open standard for any application to access
and compute against data. Microsoft’s Data Fabric enables more
flexibility to pick and choose which components are right for each
organization. The fabric architecture may also enable the consolidation
of Data Warehouses back into the Data Lake since the functionality to
serve and analyze the data will all be native, connected, and
AI-accelerated.

**Plug-ins Everywhere**

In other Microsoft news - AI Copilots and third-party plug-ins are
coming to… everything. The plug-ins, built on OpenAI's standard, bolster
copilots' interactions with diverse software. This will further
complicate the risk associated with these tools, while also unlocking
increased capabilities. This will be a space to watch closely as the
impact of the Year of AI continues to spread.

**Tracking the Spread of AI Models**

A handful of models have making a lot of news lately – GPT-4, PaLM-2,
Stable Diffusion, etc. – however there’s an explosion of research
occurring in parallel. This graph and associated dataset from Stamford’s
Center for Research on Foundation Models shows the linkage between many
other AI models, datasets, and applications. There are many models not
yet added here.

**Adobe Generative Fill**

I spent quite a bit of time early in my career working in Photoshop. If
you’ve ever experienced the challenges of manipulating layers and
getting things to look just right – this use of LLM AI is simply
mind-blowing. It’s an excellent execution of a privately trained LLM
(Adobe owns the rights to all of the source images) used to give a
product super-powers.

**ChatGPT App for iPhone**

<https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-chatgpt-app-for-ios>

OpenAI has made ChatGPT available on iOS. It's integrated with Whisper,
their speech-to-text model, enabling voice input. Use responsibly!
